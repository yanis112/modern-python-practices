```

**Python code:**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
db_url = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
```

## 🧑‍💻 VSCode's `.vscode/settings.json`: Your Virtual Sidekick

Configure VSCode to automatically activate your virtual environment!

**What it is:**
The `.vscode/settings.json` file lets you customize VSCode's behavior for your project.

**Example:**

```
my_project/
├── src/          # Source code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── data/         # Data files
├── tests/        # Unit tests
├── config.yaml   # Configuration file
├── .env          # Environment variables
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```

## 🗂️ Root Directory as Env Var: Know Where You Stand

Set your project's root directory as an environment variable to easily access it from anywhere in your code.

**What it is:**
Add your project root directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to import modules from your project no matter where you are running the script.

**Why it's awesome:**

*   **Simplified Imports:**  Import modules from your project without having to worry about relative paths.
*   **Flexibility:** Run scripts from anywhere in your project without import errors.
*   **Clean Code:**  Avoid messy `sys.path.append()` hacks in your code.

**How it saves time:**

*   **Avoid import headaches:**  No more struggling with relative imports.
*   **Write cleaner code:** Make your imports more readable and maintainable.

**Example:**

1.  Set the `PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```
PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/your/project
```

2.  Add this directory to the PYTHONPATH in your code:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
project_root = os.getenv("PROJECT_ROOT")

if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(project_root)
```

Now you can import modules from your `src` directory as if it were a top-level package. For instance:

```python
from src.utils import my_function # if src is in the root of your project
```

## 🪵 Loguru: Logging Made Easy

Tired of wrestling with Python's built-in logging module? Loguru is here to rescue you!

**What it is:**
Loguru is a Python library that makes logging enjoyable and straightforward.

**Why it's awesome:**

*   **Simplified Configuration:**  Easily configure logging to files, rotate logs, and format messages with minimal code.
*   **Colorful Output:** Loguru automatically colorizes log messages, making them easier to read.
*   **Exception Tracking:** Loguru automatically captures tracebacks within `try/except` blocks.
* **Structured Logging:** Easily use structured logging with dictionaries.

**How it saves time:**

*   **Less boilerplate:**  Write less code to set up logging.
*   **Easier debugging:**  Quickly identify and fix issues with clear, informative logs.

**Example:**

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")

try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    logger.exception("Something went wrong!")

# Log to a file, rotate every day, keep for 7 days.
logger.add("file_{time}.log", rotation="1 day", retention="7 days", level="INFO")

# structured logging
user_data = {"id": 123, "name": "Alice"}
logger.info("User info: {user}", user=user_data)

```

## 🔄 Tenacity: Retry, Retry, Retry

Dealing with flaky APIs or unreliable network connections? Tenacity has your back!

**What it is:**
Tenacity is a Python library that provides a simple, configurable way to add retry behavior to your code.

**Why it's awesome:**

*   **Automatic Retries:**  Automatically retry a function call if it raises an exception. It's like having a persistent assistant that keeps trying until it succeeds.
*   **Customizable Retry Strategies:** Control how long to wait between retries, the maximum number of attempts, and more.
*   **Handles Various Exceptions:** Specify which exceptions should trigger a retry.
*   **Easy to Use:** Decorate any function to add retry behavior.

**How it saves time:**

*   **Increased resilience:**  Make your code more robust to transient errors.
*   **Reduced manual intervention:** Avoid having to manually rerun failed operations.

**Example:**

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
import requests

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def fetch_data(url):
  """
  Fetches data from a URL, retrying up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
  First retry after 4 sec, then 8, then 10.
  """
  print(f"Attempting to fetch data from {url}...")
  response = requests.get(url)
  response.
```
